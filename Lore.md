# Lore

Saltmarsh is a nondescript fishing village tucked away on the southern coast of the Kingdom of #Keoland. For several generations, Keoland was a formidable military power. Its superior cavalry and bold knights pushed the kingdom’s borders outward to the north, west, and east. Each successful campaign increased both the crown’s wealth and power, and each one in turn drew the kingdom’s attention even farther north. The southern coastal regions of Keoland remained a backwater.  
  
The crown’s benign neglect allowed piracy and banditry to flourish. Saltmarsh and similar towns kept to fishing, content to maintain a low profile and avoid governmental entanglements. Decades ago, the pirates who prowled the waters off Saltmarsh grew strong enough to create their own realm, a loose confederacy known as the Hold of the Sea Princes #HoldOfTheSeaPrinces, led by a governing body of captains who each control their own armada and meet in secret to coordinate nefarious schemes in defiance of the crown.  

With the rise of that nation came increased raids on Saltmarsh and its neighbors. The Sea Princes’ #SeaPrinces raiding ships pillaged the coast for more slaves to support their growing realm, and Saltmarsh suffered heavily. The memories of those times loom heavily over the area, and the locals’ hatred of the Sea Princes runs deep.  

In time, #Keoland’s victories in the north gave way to a string of defeats in which its neighbors pushed the kingdom back to its original boundaries. With the world closing in, King Kimbertos #Skotti looked to the south and saw unchecked banditry and a rising pirate nation. The crown struck peace treaties with its former foes to the north, raised a navy, and dealt a sharp check to the ambitions of the Sea Princes — but the conflict is by no means over as King Skotti has decreed that the pirates must be put down, the sea lanes secured, and trade cultivated.
